# ez-raiden

A no-frills UI for interacting with the Raiden Payment Network.

> ez-raiden is a proof of concept for a new Raiden web UI. No modals; no complex interface logic; easy access to core functionality

#### What it is:
- An easy option for opening, paying, depositing to, withdrawing from and closing payment channels
- A straightforward interface for tracking token balances in payment channels and transferring those tokens to partners

#### What it needs:
- Validations, error messages, advanced features, ENS integration

#### To Get ez-raiden Running:

To use ez-raiden, you need to be running a Raiden node locally. Please refer to [Raiden's documentation here](https://raiden-network.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview_and_guide.html).

Once you've installed and instantiated your Raiden node, clone this repo and run ```npm install && npm start```.
